"Emotion_detection"
This project involves to detect the emotion of the image uploaded by the user in stream lit application.
the dataset was taken from kaggle FER2013 and also performed data cleaning and augementation and developed the CNN Architecture to train the model.
The data was splitted into train and test data and then used to develop the model in deep learning.
Requirements: Python 3.x, Jupyter Notebook, Pytorch, Visual Studio Code, CNN Architecture, EDA, Data cleaning and Streamlit

And also I attached emotion_detection project illustration in main file for detailed explanation.
